## 2. Introduction

### 2.1. Overview of GLM-4.5 Model and Deployment Challenges

The **GLM-4.5** model represents a significant advancement in large language models, characterized by a substantial parameter count. Specifically, it comprises **355 billion total parameters**, with **32 billion active parameters** engaged during the inference process . This immense scale, while contributing to the model's powerful capabilities, introduces considerable computational and memory demands. Deploying such a large model in practical scenarios necessitates innovative and efficient approaches to manage these resource constraints without compromising performance. The sheer volume of parameters translates to high memory footprints for storing model weights and activations, as well as extensive computational requirements for matrix multiplications and other tensor operations during inference. These challenges underscore the need for sophisticated compression and optimization strategies to enable feasible and cost-effective deployment, particularly in environments with limited hardware resources or stringent latency requirements. The focus of this work is to address these deployment hurdles by applying a combination of state-of-the-art compression techniques tailored for the GLM-4.5 architecture.

### 2.2. Hardware Platform: CUDA 8.6 and Volta Architecture

The optimization efforts detailed in this report are specifically targeted for hardware platforms based on the **CUDA 8.6** architecture, with a primary emphasis on **NVIDIA V100 GPUs** . The Volta architecture, which powers the V100, introduced significant features beneficial for deep learning workloads, most notably **Tensor Cores**. These specialized units are capable of performing mixed-precision matrix multiply-and-accumulate operations, significantly accelerating computations involving 16-bit floating-point (FP16) data. The CUDA 8.6 platform provides the necessary software and library support, including `cuSPARSELt`, to effectively utilize these hardware capabilities. The choice of this platform is strategic, as it allows for the exploitation of features like FP16 arithmetic for speed, INT4 quantization for memory reduction, and structured sparsity for computational efficiency. The optimizations are designed to align with the architectural characteristics of Volta GPUs, ensuring that the compression techniques translate into tangible performance gains during inference. This targeted approach ensures that the full potential of the hardware is harnessed to mitigate the challenges posed by the large scale of the GLM-4.5 model.

### 2.3. Goals of Compression: Memory, Speed, and Accuracy

The overarching goals driving the application of advanced compression techniques to the GLM-4.5 model are threefold: **memory footprint reduction**, **inference speed increase**, and **maintenance of near-lossless model accuracy**. Firstly, reducing the memory required to store and load the model is critical for deployment on GPUs with limited VRAM and for enabling larger batch sizes or longer sequence lengths. Secondly, accelerating the inference speed is paramount for real-time applications and for improving throughput, making the model more responsive and cost-effective to serve. Thirdly, and crucially, these performance gains must not come at an unacceptable cost to model accuracy. The aim is to achieve a balance where significant improvements in memory and speed are realized while the model's predictive performance remains close to that of the uncompressed baseline. These techniques are applied to key components of the GLM-4.5 architecture, including the Transformer attention blocks and feed-forward networks, which constitute the bulk of the computational load and parameter count . The success of these optimizations is measured by their collective ability to meet these interconnected goals.

## 3. Compression Techniques Applied to GLM-4.5

### 3.1. INT4 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) with AWQ

Quantization is a fundamental technique employed to reduce the precision of the model's parameters, thereby achieving substantial memory savings and potentially accelerating inference by leveraging hardware support for lower-precision arithmetic . For the GLM-4.5 model, a **post-training quantization (PTQ)** approach was adopted, specifically utilizing **Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ)**. AWQ is chosen for its ability to maintain model accuracy by carefully calibrating quantization parameters using a small, representative dataset. This calibration process helps to mitigate the accuracy degradation often associated with aggressive quantization by identifying and preserving the most salient weights or by adjusting the quantization ranges based on activation statistics. In our implementation, the primary targets for INT4 quantization were the linear layers within the model. The weights of these layers are quantized to 4-bit integers, while the activations are typically kept in a higher precision, such as FP16, to maintain numerical stability and preserve the fidelity of the computations. The `quantize_model` function from the AWQ library is used for this purpose, specifying 4 bits for quantization and a group size of 32 for grouping weights for quantization scaling factors. It is important to note that the majority of weights in the model were subjected to INT4 quantization, with a key exception being the final classifier layer, which was often kept at higher precision (e.g., FP16) to avoid significant impacts on output logits and overall task performance .

```python
from awq.quantizer import quantize_model

# Apply AWQ to the model for 4-bit quantization with a group size of 32
quantize_model(model, bits=4, group_size=32)
```

This code snippet demonstrates the application of AWQ to the GLM-4.5 model. The `bits=4` argument specifies the target quantization precision (INT4), and `group_size=32` defines the size of the groups for which scaling factors are shared. This group-wise quantization helps to achieve a better balance between compression ratio and accuracy by allowing for more fine-grained adaptation to the distribution of weights. The selection of linear layers for quantization is strategic, as these layers often account for the vast majority of parameters and computational operations in large Transformer-based models. By reducing the bit-width of these weights from FP16 (16 bits) or FP32 (32 bits) to INT4 (4 bits), a theoretical memory reduction of up to 4x can be achieved for the weights themselves, although in practice, overhead from quantization metadata (like scaling factors and zero points) slightly reduces this gain. The AWQ library handles the complex process of calibrating these quantization parameters, making the PTQ process relatively straightforward to integrate into the model deployment pipeline.

### 3.2. Structured 2:4 Sparsity Implementation

Structured sparsity is a powerful compression technique that involves imposing a specific, systematic pattern of zeros within the model's weight matrices. This approach simplifies hardware acceleration and optimizes memory access patterns compared to unstructured sparsity, where zeros can be distributed randomly . For the GLM-4.5 model, we implemented **2:4 structured sparsity**, a pattern that dictates that for every block of four consecutive weights, two must be non-zero and two must be zero. This specific 2:4 pattern is highly compatible with modern NVIDIA GPUs starting from the Ampere architecture and is well-supported by CUDA kernels and libraries like NVIDIA's `cuSPARSELt` . While Volta GPUs (CUDA 8.6) do not have native hardware support for 2:4 sparsity in the same way Ampere and later architectures do, the structured nature of the sparsity can still lead to performance benefits through optimized software kernels and reduced data movement. The 2:4 sparsity pattern effectively reduces the number of active (non-zero) weights in the pruned layers by approximately 50%, leading to a significant reduction in model size and potentially doubling the throughput for matrix operations if the hardware and software stack can efficiently skip the zero computations .

The application of 2:4 sparsity was targeted at the attention and linear layers within the GLM-4.5 model, utilizing the `torch.ao.pruning` module available in PyTorch 1.13 and later versions. The `prune.ln_structured` function was employed to achieve this, specifically performing L-n structured pruning along a specified dimension. A custom scoring function can be used to determine which weights to prune, but in many cases, magnitude-based pruning is sufficient, where weights with the smallest magnitudes are set to zero to achieve the desired 2:4 pattern.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.utils.prune as prune

# Example: Applying 2:4 structured sparsity to the value projection weights in an attention module
# 'module' refers to a specific layer or sub-module within the GLM-4.5 model
# 'amount=0.5' specifies 50% sparsity (2 out of 4 elements are zero)
# 'n=2' and 'dim=0' define the 2:4 pattern along dimension 0 (e.g., output channels)
prune.ln_structured(
    module.attention.self.value.weight,  # Target weight tensor
    name='weight',                       # Parameter name within the module to prune
    amount=0.5,                          # Fraction of connections to prune (50% for 2:4)
    n=2,                                 # Number of non-zeros in the block (N for N:M)
    dim=0                                # Dimension along which to apply the pruning
)
# Make the pruning permanent (remove the re-parametrization and zeroed-out weights)
prune.remove(module.attention.self.value, 'weight')
```

This code snippet illustrates how 2:4 sparsity is applied to the `value.weight` parameter of an attention module. The `amount=0.5` parameter ensures that 50% of the weights are pruned, which is consistent with the 2:4 sparsity ratio. The `n=2` argument specifies that within each block of 4 elements (implied by the 50% sparsity and the Ln-structured pruning function), 2 elements should be non-zero. The `dim=0` argument indicates that this pattern is applied along the first dimension of the weight tensor. After pruning, `prune.remove` is typically called to make the pruning permanent by removing the original parameter and storing only the pruned version along with the pruning mask. The consistent 2:4 pattern is crucial for enabling efficient GPU utilization, as it allows for specialized kernels to leverage this structured sparsity for faster computation, even if emulated on Volta architecture through optimized software. The reduction in active weights directly translates to a smaller model size and can lead to significant speedups if the underlying hardware and software can efficiently skip computations involving the zeroed weights.

### 3.3. Mixed Precision Inference Strategy

To further optimize memory usage and computational speed, a **mixed precision inference** strategy was implemented for the GLM-4.5 model . This technique leverages the capabilities of modern GPUs, particularly the Tensor Cores available in NVIDIA's Volta architecture and later, which are designed to perform matrix operations significantly faster in 16-bit floating-point (FP16) precision compared to 32-bit floating-point (FP32). The core idea of mixed precision inference is to use lower-precision data types (like FP16) for computations where it is numerically stable and does not significantly impact accuracy, while reserving higher precision (FP32) for operations that are more sensitive to precision loss. In the context of the GLM-4.5 model, this strategy involved performing key matrix multiplications, such as the Query, Key, Value (QKV) projections within Transformer attention blocks and the operations in the feed-forward networks, in FP16 precision. This allows the model to benefit from the increased throughput and reduced memory bandwidth requirements of FP16 computations.

However, to maintain numerical stability and prevent the accumulation of errors that can occur with lower precision, certain parts of the model were kept in FP32. This typically includes operations like layer normalization, softmax, and the final logits computation, which can be sensitive to precision and where small errors can propagate and magnify. PyTorch's `torch.cuda.amp` (Automatic Mixed Precision) module provides convenient tools, such as `autocast`, to implement mixed precision training and inference. Within an `autocast` context, PyTorch automatically chooses the precision for each operation, casting tensors to FP16 or FP32 as needed.

```python
import torch

# Assuming 'model' is the GLM-4.5 model and 'inputs' are the input tensors
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    # Forward pass through the model features
    feature_output = model.feature_extractor(inputs)  # Example: up to the final layers
    # Final classifier layer (often kept in FP32 or handled outside autocast if sensitive)
    logits = model.classifier(feature_output)         # Classifier might operate in FP32

# If the classifier is sensitive, it might be run outside the autocast context
# or specific parts of the model can be explicitly cast to FP32.
```

The CUDA platform's Tensor Cores efficiently handle the FP16 matrix operations, leading to significant speedups without a substantial loss in accuracy, provided that the mixed precision strategy is carefully designed . The reduction in memory usage comes from storing activations and weights in FP16 for a large portion of the model, effectively halving their memory footprint compared to FP32. This careful balance between FP16 for performance and FP32 for stability is key to the success of the mixed precision inference strategy, allowing the GLM-4.5 model to achieve faster inference times and lower memory consumption while preserving its predictive capabilities.

### 3.4. Layer-wise Optimization Strategies for MoE Architecture

The GLM-4.5 model, particularly if it incorporates a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture, benefits from layer-wise optimization strategies that tailor compression techniques to the specific characteristics and sensitivities of different components within the model. This nuanced approach ensures that optimizations are applied where they are most effective and least detrimental to accuracy. For instance, **embedding layers**, which map discrete input tokens to dense vector representations, are often highly sensitive to quantization noise due to the sparse nature of their updates and the importance of precise representations. Therefore, these layers are typically held at a higher precision, such as FP16, and are generally not subjected to aggressive quantization or pruning. Maintaining the fidelity of embeddings is crucial as they form the initial input to the model and can significantly impact downstream computations.

In contrast, the **Transformer blocks**, which form the core of the GLM-4.5 architecture and contain the bulk of the parameters and computations (including attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks), are prime candidates for aggressive optimization. Both the attention and feed-forward portions within these blocks underwent **INT4 quantization** and **2:4 structured sparsity**. These layers are typically more robust to precision reduction and sparsification, and the sheer number of parameters involved means that compressing them yields substantial memory and speed benefits. The MoE architecture, if present, involves a gating mechanism that routes tokens to a subset of "expert" networks. These expert networks, often themselves dense feed-forward layers, are also strong candidates for quantization and sparsity. The inherent sparsity in MoE models, where only a fraction of experts are active for a given input, already provides a form of dynamic sparsity, which can complement the static 2:4 sparsity applied within each expert.

Finally, **normalization layers**, such as LayerNorm, are critical for stabilizing training and ensuring consistent activations throughout the network. These layers often involve computations that can be sensitive to precision, such as variance calculations and division by small numbers. To preserve accuracy fidelity, these normalization layers are typically preserved as FP32. This segmentation of optimization strategies—FP16 for embeddings, INT4 and 2:4 sparsity for Transformer blocks (including MoE experts), and FP32 for normalization layers—ensures that the computationally heavy matrix multiplication layers are aggressively optimized while numerically sensitive operations are handled with care, striking a balance between performance gains and accuracy preservation.

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1. Software and Libraries: PyTorch, AWQ, cuSPARSELt

The implementation of the advanced compression techniques for the GLM-4.5 model leveraged a combination of established and specialized software libraries. **PyTorch 1.13 or later** served as the foundational deep learning framework, primarily due to its native and mature support for essential modules related to model pruning and quantization . The `torch.ao.pruning` module, for instance, was instrumental in applying the 2:4 structured sparsity. For the INT4 post-training quantization, the **AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) library** was utilized. This library, available from `https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Community/AWQ`, provides robust tools for calibrating and applying 4-bit quantization to model weights, focusing on minimizing accuracy degradation . While direct hardware support for 2:4 sparsity on Volta architecture (CUDA 8.6) is limited compared to newer architectures like Ampere, the structured nature of the sparsity can still be exploited. For environments with more recent CUDA versions and hardware, **NVIDIA's `cuSPARSELt` library** offers highly optimized routines for sparse matrix operations, including those with 2:4 sparsity patterns. Although CUDA 8.6 predates `cuSPARSELt` (which is more commonly associated with Ampere and Hopper architectures), the principles of structured sparsity can still lead to performance gains through custom or optimized kernels that can efficiently handle the 2:4 pattern, even if not at the same peak performance as on newer hardware. The integration of these tools allowed for a comprehensive compression pipeline, from quantizing weights with AWQ to pruning with PyTorch's native functionalities.

### 4.2. CUDA 8.6 Compiler Flags and APIs

To ensure that the compiled model and its associated kernels were optimized for the target **Volta GPU architecture (compute capability sm_70)** under **CUDA 8.6**, specific compiler flags and API usage were employed. The primary CUDA compiler, `nvcc`, was invoked with the architecture flag `-arch=sm_70`. This flag directs the compiler to generate PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) code and SASS (Streaming ASSembly) code specifically optimized for the Volta architecture's features, including its Tensor Cores for mixed-precision FP16 computations and its general execution units. While Volta GPUs do not have native hardware support for INT4 Tensor Core operations in the same way as Ampere or Hopper, the CUDA 8.6 toolkit, in conjunction with libraries like `cuSPARSELt` (for general sparse operations, though 2:4 acceleration is more limited on Volta), allows for the development of optimized kernels that can still benefit from lower precision arithmetic and structured sparsity patterns. The `__CUDA_ARCH__` macro can be used within CUDA C++ code to conditionally compile code paths specific to the Volta architecture, enabling developers to tailor kernel implementations to the hardware's capabilities. For example, FP16 operations were explicitly targeted to leverage Tensor Cores, and specific memory access patterns were optimized to align with Volta's memory hierarchy. The use of `cuBLAS` and `cuDNN` libraries, compatible with CUDA 8.6, was also crucial for accelerating standard dense and convolutional operations, respectively, ensuring that the non-sparse and non-quantized parts of the model also performed optimally.

### 4.3. Example Training/Inference API Call

The deployment of the optimized GLM-4.5 model, incorporating INT4 quantization, 2:4 sparsity, and mixed precision, would typically be managed through an inference serving framework. While a full training API call for such a complex optimization pipeline is beyond the scope of this report (as PTQ and pruning are often applied post-training or with specialized fine-tuning scripts), an example inference API call using a hypothetical serving framework (e.g., `vLLM` or `TensorRT`) can be conceptualized. For instance, if using `vLLM` with AWQ support, as seen with GLM-4.5-Air , the command to serve the model might look like:

```bash
# Conceptual example for serving GLM-4.5 with vLLM, assuming AWQ and sparsity are handled
vllm serve glm-4.5-optimized --dtype float16 --quantization awq --sparsity 2:4 --tensor-parallel-size <N>
```

In this conceptual command:
*   `glm-4.5-optimized` refers to the directory or identifier for the compressed GLM-4.5 model.
*   `--dtype float16` suggests that activations or overall computation might still occur in FP16, with weights being INT4.
*   `--quantization awq` specifies that AWQ was used for INT4 quantization.
*   `--sparsity 2:4` indicates that 2:4 structured sparsity is applied and should be leveraged.
*   `--tensor-parallel-size <N>` would specify the degree of tensor model parallelism, crucial for a model of GLM-4.5's size.

The actual implementation would involve more complex setup, including loading the model with specific configurations for AWQ and sparse kernels, and ensuring the inference engine correctly dispatches operations to optimized kernels compatible with CUDA 8.6 and Volta architecture. For example, the `quantize_model` function shown in section 3.1 would be part of the model preparation pipeline, and the pruning steps from section 3.2 would be applied to generate the sparse weight matrices. The inference API would then load this pre-optimized model.

## 5. Performance Benchmarks (Theoretical and Estimated)

The application of advanced compression techniques to the GLM-4.5 model is anticipated to yield significant improvements in memory footprint and inference speed, while aiming to maintain near-lossless accuracy. The following table summarizes the theoretical and estimated performance gains for each technique.

| Technique                     | Target Layers                     | Theoretical Memory Reduction | Theoretical Speedup (Hardware Dependent) | Key Considerations for Accuracy                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

*Table 1: Summary of Compression Techniques and Expected Performance Gains for GLM-4.5.*

### 5.1. Memory Footprint Reduction

The combined application of INT4 PTQ and 2:4 sparsity is expected to lead to a **dramatic reduction in the memory footprint** of the GLM-4.5 model. INT4 quantization alone can reduce the size of the quantized weights by approximately **4 times** compared to FP16. When combined with 2:4 sparsity, which effectively halves the number of stored weights in targeted layers, the overall model size can be significantly compressed. For instance, if a large portion of the model's parameters (e.g., 90%) are in linear layers targeted by both techniques, the effective compression can approach **8x for those layers** (4x from INT4 and 2x from 2:4 sparsity). Considering that linear layers often constitute the vast majority of parameters in LLMs, this translates to a substantial overall reduction. For the full GLM-4.5 model with 355 billion parameters, if we assume FP16 storage (2 bytes/param) as baseline (710GB), aggressive application of these techniques could potentially bring the model size down to a range that is more manageable for deployment on multiple high-end GPUs or even a single server with sufficient VRAM, though distributed deployment would still be likely for real-time performance. The mixed precision strategy, by storing activations and weights in FP16 for most parts, also contributes to memory savings compared to a full FP32 model.

### 5.2. Inference Speedup

**Inference speedup** is a critical goal, and the proposed techniques offer multiple avenues for acceleration. **INT4 operations**, if efficiently supported by the hardware (Volta has some INT4 capabilities via DP4A and specific Tensor Core instructions, though less optimized than Ampere for general INT4 GEMM), can lead to faster computation due to reduced data movement and more operations per cycle. A theoretical speedup of **1.5x to 2x** for INT4 matrix multiplications compared to FP16 is often cited, though actual gains depend heavily on kernel efficiency and memory bandwidth. **Structured 2:4 sparsity** aims to double the throughput of matrix operations by skipping computations with zero weights. On architectures with native support (Ampere+), this can yield significant speedups (e.g., 1.2x to 1.5x end-to-end observed in some BERT models ). On Volta, the gains would rely on optimized software kernels, potentially leading to more modest but still valuable speedups due to reduced data volume and computation. **Mixed precision inference** leveraging FP16 Tensor Cores on Volta can provide substantial speedups, often in the range of **2x to 3x** for eligible FP16 operations compared to their FP32 counterparts. The cumulative effect of these techniques, applied strategically across the model, is expected to significantly reduce latency and increase tokens processed per second, making GLM-4.5 more viable for real-time applications.

### 5.3. Accuracy Considerations and Maintenance

Maintaining **near-lossless accuracy** is paramount. Aggressive compression techniques inherently risk degrading model performance. **INT4 PTQ with AWQ** is specifically chosen for its ability to preserve accuracy by adaptively scaling weights based on activation statistics, thereby protecting salient features . The calibration process and careful selection of layers to quantize (e.g., excluding `lm_head` or sensitive MoE gating layers) are crucial. For **2:4 structured sparsity**, a fine-tuning or retraining phase after pruning is typically necessary to allow the model to recover from the loss of pruned weights and adapt to the sparse structure . The quality of the pruning algorithm (e.g., magnitude-based) and the fine-tuning dataset also play significant roles. **Mixed precision inference** is generally well-tolerated by modern deep learning models, especially when FP32 is used for sensitive operations like normalization and softmax. The `torch.cuda.amp` module helps manage this by automatically casting operations, minimizing precision-related errors. The overall strategy involves iterative optimization: applying a technique, evaluating accuracy on relevant benchmarks, and adjusting parameters or fine-tuning as needed. The goal is to keep the accuracy degradation to a minimum, ideally within **0.5% to 1%** of the original FP16/FP32 model's performance on key tasks, ensuring that the compressed GLM-4.5 remains a highly capable language model.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1. Synergy of Quantization and Sparsity in LLMs

The combination of **quantization and sparsity** offers a powerful synergistic effect for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) like GLM-4.5. While each technique provides individual benefits, their joint application can lead to compounded gains in efficiency. Quantization, such as reducing weights to INT4, primarily targets the memory footprint and can speed up computation by enabling lower-precision arithmetic. Sparsity, particularly structured 2:4 sparsity, reduces the number of effective parameters and computations by introducing zeros into the weight matrices. When applied together, a model can first be pruned to a 2:4 sparse pattern, and then the remaining non-zero weights can be quantized to INT4. This means that not only are the computations sparse, but the values involved in those computations are also represented with fewer bits. This dual compression can lead to significantly smaller model sizes than either technique alone and can further accelerate inference. For example, if 2:4 sparsity halves the active weights and INT4 quantization reduces the bit-width by a factor of 4 (compared to FP16), the combined effect on weight storage for those layers could approach an 8x reduction. The challenge lies in ensuring that the combined application does not lead to an unacceptable cumulative loss in accuracy, necessitating careful calibration, fine-tuning, and potentially co-design of the pruning and quantization processes.

### 6.2. Impact of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture

The **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture** in GLM-4.5 presents unique opportunities and challenges for model compression. MoE models are inherently more parameter-efficient during inference than dense models of the same total size because only a subset of experts is activated for each input token. This conditional computation already provides a form of dynamic sparsity. However, the total number of parameters, including all experts, still needs to be stored, which is a major memory challenge. Compression techniques like **INT4 quantization and 2:4 sparsity can be applied to the individual expert networks** as well as the shared layers of the model. This can significantly reduce the storage required for each expert. Furthermore, the gating mechanism that routes tokens to experts is a critical component. While small, its precision is important for accurate routing decisions. It might be kept at a higher precision (e.g., FP16) or quantized carefully. Layer-wise optimization strategies are particularly important for MoE models. For instance, different experts might exhibit varying sensitivities to quantization or pruning, and adaptive bit-widths or sparsity levels per expert could be beneficial, as suggested by frameworks like "Mixture Compressor" . The communication overhead associated with routing tokens to experts and gathering their outputs also needs to be considered, as compression might alter activation sizes or data transfer patterns.

### 6.3. Viability of INT4 and Hardware Efficiency of 2:4 Sparsity

The **viability of INT4 precision** for LLMs has been increasingly demonstrated by various research and industry efforts, including its application to models like GLM-4.5-Air . INT4 offers a substantial 4x memory reduction for weights compared to FP16 and can lead to faster computations if the hardware supports efficient INT4 arithmetic. While **Volta architecture (CUDA 8.6)** has some support for INT4 operations (e.g., DP4A instructions for dot products, and specific Tensor Core instructions like `mma.m16n8k64` for INT4 matrix multiplies accumulating to INT32 ), its efficiency for general INT4 GEMM (General Matrix Multiply) operations is not as mature or widespread as in later architectures like Ampere or Hopper. Therefore, achieving optimal speedups with INT4 on Volta might require custom kernel development or rely on software libraries that can effectively map INT4 computations to the available hardware primitives. The success of INT4 heavily relies on sophisticated PTQ algorithms like AWQ to maintain accuracy.

Regarding **2:4 structured sparsity**, its hardware efficiency is most pronounced on **NVIDIA Ampere GPUs and later**, which feature Sparse Tensor Cores specifically designed to accelerate 2:4 sparse matrix multiplications, offering up to 2x theoretical speedup . While **Volta GPUs do not have these dedicated Sparse Tensor Cores**, the 2:4 pattern itself is still beneficial. The structured nature allows for compressed storage (halving the weight data) and can enable optimized software kernels to skip zero computations, leading to memory bandwidth savings and potentially faster execution compared to dense operations, even if not achieving the full 2x speedup seen on Ampere. Libraries like `cuSPARSELt` provide APIs for handling 2:4 sparsity, and while their peak performance is on newer hardware, the underlying principles can guide implementations on Volta. The key is that the 2:4 pattern is fine-grained enough to be effective for accuracy while structured enough to allow for efficient implementation.

### 6.4. Future Work: Dynamic Sparsity and Lower Precision

Looking ahead, several avenues for further optimizing models like GLM-4.5 exist. **Dynamic sparsity** is an emerging area where the sparsity pattern is not fixed after training but can adapt at inference time based on the input. This could potentially offer greater compression and speedup by identifying and skipping redundant computations specific to each input instance. Techniques that combine dynamic sparsity with MoE architectures, where expert activation is already dynamic, are particularly promising. Exploring **even lower precision formats**, such as **2-bit or ternary weights**, could yield further memory savings, though this presents significant challenges in maintaining accuracy and requires highly specialized quantization algorithms and hardware support. Research into **hybrid precision models**, where different layers or even different parts of layers use different numerical formats (e.g., a mix of 2-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit) based on their sensitivity, could provide a more fine-grained trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, **algorithm-hardware co-design** will be crucial. As new compression techniques are developed, hardware architectures will also evolve to better support them, leading to a continuous cycle of improvement in LLM efficiency. Continued research into robust PTQ methods that can handle diverse model architectures and datasets with minimal calibration overhead will also be vital for widespread adoption of these advanced compression techniques.
